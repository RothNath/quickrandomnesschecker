# RandomnessQuickCheck.py üìä

A lightweight Python utility for performing **preliminary statistical checks** on binary bitstreams. This tool is designed for a **quick assessment** to determine if a set of 0s and 1s is plausibly random before proceeding with more exhaustive and computationally intensive standard test suites like NIST SP 800-22. This was orignally setup to check strings generated by a quantum computer / qiskit quickly. Author contact: nath.jroth@ p r o t o n m a i l . com

## üéØ Purpose

In the realm of random number generation, it's crucial to verify the quality of the output. This script acts as a **first line of defense**, offering a rapid way to detect obvious non-random patterns or biases in a binary sequence. It helps you quickly decide if your generated data is worth a deeper, more rigorous analysis using advanced statistical test suites.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Frequency (Monobit) Test:** Checks for an equal proportion of 0s and 1s.

* **Runs Test:** Identifies whether the number of consecutive identical bits falls within expected statistical ranges.

* **Longest Run of Ones Test:** Verifies that the longest sequence of identical bits (0s or 1s) is not unusually long or short.

* **Binary Matrix Rank Test:** Detects linear dependencies within fixed-size matrices formed from the bitstream, indicating structural patterns.

* **Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test:** Analyzes the frequency domain of the bitstream to identify hidden periodicities or repeating patterns.

* **Clear & Concise Output:** Provides formatted results for each test, including `‚úÖ PASS` / `‚ùå FAIL` indicators and descriptive details.

* **Overall Assessment:** Gives a summarized conclusion based on the combined test results.

* **Platform Agnostic:** Designed to work with any binary string input, regardless of its generation source (e.g., Quantum Random Number Generator, classical Pseudorandom Number Generator, etc.).

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided Python code as `RandomnessQuickCheck.py`.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy
    ```

3.  **Prepare Your Input File:**
    * Create a plain text file (e.g., `my_bits.txt`).
    * Populate this file with your binary sequence (a string of '0's and '1's).
    * The program will automatically remove any whitespace characters (spaces, newlines, tabs) from the file content, allowing for flexible formatting (e.g., `0110 1011 1001` or `0110\n1011`).
    * **Example `my_bits.txt` content:**
        ```
        01101011100101010110
        10110101101011010111
        00101011010110101
        ```
    * **Important:** For meaningful results, especially with the Matrix Rank and DFT tests, your sequence should be **sufficiently long** (e.g., 10,000 to 100,000+ bits).

4.  **Run the Program:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `RandomnessQuickCheck.py`, and run:

    ```bash
    python RandomnessQuickCheck.py
    ```
    The program will then **prompt you to enter the path** to your input file.
